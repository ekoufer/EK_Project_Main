elow are descriptions of the BLAST sequences I recorded, also in this folder.

Sequences were taken from BLAST output and downloaded as FASTA files.

With each input, there is a short note about why that protein was chosen, thier accession number from Uniprot, and any links to papers with further information about the protein.


1. Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 17
        Domain: WD40_2
        Accession number:Q96PE2
        Interval from JIP3 sequence: 947-1171
        -only result for PSI-BLAST for JIP3
2. JIP4
        Accession number: O60271
        -Paralog to JIP3
3. Cytoplasmic dynein 1 light intermediate chain 1
        Accession number: Q9Y6G9
        Link: https://rupress.org/jcb/article/221/8/e202110057/213353/JIP3-interacts-with-dynein-and-kinesin-1-to
        -Process involving JIP3: preventing lysosome accumulation in axons 
4. Rab-interacting lysosomal protein
        Accession: Q96NA2
        Link: https://rupress.org/jcb/article/221/8/e202110057/213353/JIP3-interacts-with-dynein-and-kinesin-1-to
        -Also connected to lysosome function of JIP3
5. JNK stress
        Accession number: Q966Y3
        -Possibly regulated by JIP3. Heavily mentioned in UniProt description of JIP3
6. Myosin-13
        Accession number: Q9UKX3
        -One of the proteins in a JNK/JIP3 comparison search. Similar function to JIP3
7. Lamin B2
